This repository contains the analysis scripts and predictive models supporting the **Relational Mathematical Realism (RMR)** framework. This work identifies a universal discrete spacetime structure with tetrahedral symmetry, manifesting across 19 orders of magnitude in energy scale—from nuclear transitions to neutron star glitches.

## 🔬 Core Hypothesis

The fundamental structure of spacetime is a discrete 5-dimensional relational matrix. Physical laws emerge from the geometric constraints of this grid, specifically governed by the **tetrahedral Maraldi angle** ($\theta = \arccos(-1/3) \approx 109.47^\circ$). 

At this "Magic Angle," the second Legendre polynomial $P_2(\cos\theta)$ vanishes, causing angular correlation functions to become "pure hexadecapole." This creates a geometric "Safe Harbor" that stabilizes both microscopic and macroscopic systems.



## 📊 Lines of Evidence

1. **Absorption (Compton Scattering):** Analysis of Co60 scattering at 662 keV reveals a plateau at $109.6^\circ$ with a **183x variance reduction**, indicating the grid acts as an angular momentum sink.
2. **Emission (Nuclear Correlations):** Cd110 $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlations show **11–65x variance reduction** at the tetrahedral angle relative to the 45° geometric stress point.
3. **Collective (Pulsar Glitches):** Magnitude ratios of 726 pulsar glitches follow a harmonic sequence ($2.0, 1.5, 1.33, 1.25, 1.20$) correlating ($r = 0.949$) with tetrahedral grid harmonics.
