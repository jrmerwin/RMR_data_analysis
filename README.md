This repository contains the analysis scripts and predictive models supporting the **Relational Mathematical Realism (RMR)** framework. This work identifies a universal discrete spacetime structure with tetrahedral symmetry, manifesting across 19 orders of magnitude in energy scale—from nuclear transitions to neutron star glitches.

## 🔬 Core Hypothesis

The fundamental structure of spacetime is a discrete 5-dimensional relational matrix. Physical laws emerge from the geometric constraints of this grid, specifically governed by the **tetrahedral Maraldi angle** ($\theta = \arccos(-1/3) \approx 109.47^\circ$). 

At this "Magic Angle," the second Legendre polynomial $P_2(\cos\theta)$ vanishes, causing angular correlation functions to become "pure hexadecapole." This creates a geometric "Safe Harbor" that stabilizes both microscopic and macroscopic systems.



## 📊 Lines of Evidence

1. **Absorption (Compton Scattering):** Analysis of Co60 scattering at 662 keV reveals a plateau at $109.6^\circ$ with a **183x variance reduction**, indicating the grid acts as an angular momentum sink.
2. **Emission (Nuclear Correlations):** Cd110 $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlations show **11–65x variance reduction** at the tetrahedral angle relative to the 45° geometric stress point.
3. **Collective (Pulsar Glitches):** Magnitude ratios of 726 pulsar glitches follow a harmonic sequence ($2.0, 1.5, 1.33, 1.25, 1.20$) correlating ($r = 0.949$) with tetrahedral grid harmonics.

# Relational Mathematical Realism (RMR) overlap with Relational Harmonics Model (RHM): Unified Spacetime Framework

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and theoretical formalization of **Relational Mathematical Realism (RMR)**, a discrete network framework for spacetime. RMR proposes that physical reality emerges from a tetrahedral relational matrix governed by a 137-bit information budget and a $5/4$ temporal ratio. 

 **Relational Harmonics Model (RHM)**[cite: 4] recently proposesd that fundamental particles are persistent harmonic resonances where quantum numbers like charge and color emerge from specific phase relationships within a layered tetrahedral geometry1111. 
 
 The two frameworks overlap as RMR provides the "hardware" metrics—the $137$ constraint and $5/4$ ratio that quantify the inter-layer coupling tensions and "Higgs Horizon" frequencies predicted by RHM’s structural ontology

## The RMR-RHM Synthesis: Hardware & Software
By linking the network metrics of RMR with the harmonic layers of RHM, we define a unified "Operating System" for the vacuum:

* **Geometric Substrate:** RMR defines a tetrahedral network where each node (slot) is anchored by four connections. [cite_start]The fourth connection serves as the Gauge Axis for the $L_2$ (charge) and $L_3$ (color) layers defined in RHM[cite: 5, 83, 86].
* **The Simplex Constraint:** RHM derives fractional charges from a tetrahedral simplex projection where $\cos \theta = -1/3$[cite: 5, 184]. This confirms the **$109.47^\circ$ Maraldi angle** identified in RMR scattering and nuclear data.[[Bair-Mosheh](https://vixra.org/abs/2512.0066)]
* **Mass as Tension:** Rest mass is interpreted as the inter-layer coupling tension between $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$[cite: 5, 73, 97]. The RMR **$5/4$ ratio ($1.25$)** serves as the fundamental coefficient of this tension. [[Bair-Mosheh](https://vixra.org/abs/2512.0066)]

## 2026 Observational Window: Dual Validation
The framework is subject to immediate falsification through two independent observations scheduled for early 2026:

### 1. Macroscopic: The Crab Pulsar Glitch
* **Prediction:** A quantized magnitude jump ($\approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$) in the Crab Pulsar rotation, governed by the $5/4$ gear ratio and tetrahedral state-transition dynamics.
* **Window:** February 2026.

### 2. Microscopic: The Higgs Horizon Feature (LuSEE-Night)
* **Prediction:** A non-thermal spectral excess centered at **24.6 MHz** in the cosmological radio background.
* [cite_start]**Instrument:** The **LuSEE-Night** mission (Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment) deployed on the lunar farside[cite: 636, 656].
* **Significance:** Detection of this signal confirms the saturation of vacuum tension at the Higgs scale as predicted by the RMR hardware metrics.

## Fundamental Derivation: The Higgs Mass
A cornerstone of this synthesis is the derivation of the Higgs resonance from hardware constants. By scaling the **Planck Energy ($E_P$)** by the 137-bit budget (partitioned across the 8-fold symmetric configuration space of $L_3$) and the $5/4$ temporal ratio, we recover the Higgs mass scale:

$$E_{H} \approx \frac{E_{P}}{(137)^8} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{4}\right) \approx 123.0 \text{ GeV}$$

This derivation provides the RMR agreement for the **24.6 MHz Higgs Horizon** spectral prediction of RHM.
